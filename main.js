/**
 * Notible Sync Simple — replicate a workspace between your own machines through
 * your own Google Drive, with NO device pairing.
 *
 * The difference from "Notible Sync", and the whole point of this file: the
 * encryption key is kept on the Drive account, in the same folder as the
 * snapshots. Every device signed in to that account picks it up and syncs
 * with no setup — and so does anybody else who opens that account. They can
 * read the notes, write to them, roll edits back, and permanently delete the
 * workspace on every device. Snapshots are still encrypted, but the only
 * thing that protects against now is one snapshot leaking WITHOUT the key
 * file, and network intermediaries. Nothing else. Do not soften this comment
 * or the panel text that repeats it: a mode that does not protect must not
 * look like the mode that does.
 *
 * Spec, including the price named in full:
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-20-sync-without-pairing-design.md
 *
 * The two plugins never share a Drive folder (FOLDER_NAME differs), so a
 * device left on the private plugin is simply absent here rather than
 * appearing as a broken peer.
 *
 * One ES module, no build step, no dependencies. Crypto is WebCrypto,
 * compression is CompressionStream, both native.
 *
 * Design notes and the reasoning behind the trade-offs:
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-18-sync-plugin-design.md
 *
 * The pure functions below are exported by name so `self-check.mjs` can run
 * them under plain node; the plugin itself is the default export.
